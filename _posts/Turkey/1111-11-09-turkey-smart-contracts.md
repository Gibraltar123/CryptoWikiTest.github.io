Smart contracts are self-executing contracts put into operation using a computer code and performed by a network system without any human input following its initiation by the parties. 

A smart contract is different from a traditional contract performed via computers. A smart contract is executed and performed autonomously without the parties being able to interfere, or run the risk of it being tampered with. Under Turkish law, a legal contract must include an offer and an acceptance as well as the intentions of the parties that the contract should be legally binding.
